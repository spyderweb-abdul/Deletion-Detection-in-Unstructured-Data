# Pattern-Recognition-and-Reconstruction-Detecting-Malicious-Deletions-in-Textual-Communications
Abstract: 
Digital  forensic  artifacts  aim  to  provide  evidencefrom  digital  sources  for  attributing  blame  to  suspects,  assessingtheir intents, corroborating their statements or alibis, etc. Textualdata  is  a  significant  source  of  artifacts,  which  can  take  variousforms,  for  instance  in  the  form  of  communications.  E-mails,memos,  tweets,  and  text  messages  are  all  examples  of  textualcommunications.  Complex  statistical,  linguistic  and  other  scien-tific procedures can be manually applied to this data to uncoversignificant   clues   that   point   the   way   to   factual   information.While  expert   investigators  can   undertake  this   task,  there   isa  possibility  that  critical  information  is  missed  or  overlooked.The  primary  objective  of  this  work  is  to  aid  investigators  bypartially automating the detection of suspicious e-mail deletions.Our approach consists in building a dynamic graph to representthe  temporal  evolution  of  communications,  and  then  using  aVariational Graph Autoencoder to detect possible e-mail deletionsin  this  graph.  Our  model  uses  multiple  types  of  features  forrepresenting node and edge attributes, some of which are basedon  metadata  of  the  messages  and  the  rest  are  extracted  fromthe  contents  using  natural  language  processing  and  text  miningtechniques.  We  use  the  autoencoder  to  detect  missing  edges,which  we  interpret  as  potential  deletions;  and  to  reconstructtheir  features,  from  which  we  emit  hypotheses  about  the  topicsof  deleted  messages.  We  conducted  an  empirical  evaluation  ofour  model  on  the  Enron  e-mail  dataset,  which  shows  that  ourmodel  is  able  to  accurately  detect  a  significant  proportion  ofmissing  communications  and  to  reconstruct  the  correspondingtopic  vectors.Index  Termsâ€”Digital  Forensics,  Variational  Graph  Autoen-coders,  Forensic  Artificial  Intelligence
